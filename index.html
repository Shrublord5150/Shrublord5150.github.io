                <p><img class="image" src="not-found.png" />Greetings and salutations! As you can already tell from this page, my name is Daniel Murphy and currently I am learning how to code! So far the process has been a roller coaster with several ups and downs, but once that piece of code finally works, well there's nothing quite like that feeling.</p>

                <p>So a little bit about me...where to begin? Well, I graduated from UCF with a degree in Psychology way back in May of 2013. If I am being honest, I became bored with Psychology during my Junior year but decided to finish up the degree because I didn't really know what else to do. After graduation I left my psychology degree to the dust on my wall and ventured into various fields of work including financial work (as an assistant or file keeper or whatever), insurance, and food service. All these jobs were fun and interesting at first, but after a while I felt the need to move on.</p>
                
                <p>I re-enrolled at UCF in the fall of 2015, this time with my sights set on an English degree with a focus in Technical Communication or Technical Writing. I stumbled onto the technical writing path through my interest in creative writing and while I was searching for some type of freelance writing job, I kept finding positions for "Technical Writers". After a few minutes of Google research, I thought technical writing was something I could learn to do that would allow me to hone certain writing skills while also providing me with a creative outlet. The paycheck for these positions was a nice motivator too. Needless to say, I was headed back to UCF.</p>
            
                <p>While in the last semester of my technical writing degree, I enrolled in a beginners coding class which taught HTML and CSS. In the beginning of the course I thought I might have made a mistake as the majority of the students were I.T. majors and most of them already had a strong understanding of web development. After a few weeks of delving into the process, I began to feel more comfortable with coding and soon coding class became my favorite. A few months later I graduated with my degree in technical writing, and now I am enrolled in this coding bootcamp to learn what it takes to become a full stack web developer.</p>

                <p>The reason I enjoy coding so much is that the process of learning it resembles that of learning a new instrument or song. Music is a huge passion of mine and whenever I start learning a new song on piano or guitar, often times my hands can't quite sync up differing rhythms. It starts slowly and painfully and can be disheartning at times, but when both hands finally start flowing and work perfectly together, a song is produced. And there is no greater feeling when all the hard work finally pays off. For me, the coding process is exactly the same. Its frustrating and difficult, but when your code finally works...well, its like music to my ears.</p>
